        		<h1>Our Story</h1>
                <hr>
        	<p>Resonance was founded by Aifric Nolan, Fareed Idris, Conor Lacey, Sean Dyer and Conor McGovern. Their story began when they started studying in Dublin City University in Ireland. They shared a module together called Digital Innovation and Management Enterprise, in which they were instructed to design a product together. This is when the company was formally founded. Inspired by the design of their first product, Auto-Translate, they founded Resonance on the 1st of March 2018. Working from the college computer laboratories, they built a product that would set them on a path to success. </p> <p> Fareed orignially came up with the company name <i>Resonance</i>, and the others instantly fell in love with it. It was decided. This was the name that would be well-known for generations to come. Initially, their main marketing strategies were mere posters.

                  <p> After some time, Resonance expanded rapidly and caught the attention of not only the academic community, but many investors as well. The company has grown beyond the dreams of any of the founders, and is the stepping stone to a new era of technological innovation. Resonance invents at the boundary of technology to make amazing experiences possible, with a dedication to success.</p>
