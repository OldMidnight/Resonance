        <h3>Job Creation And Investment</h3>
        <hr>
        <p> Resonance is a powerful engine of growth for the national economy, revitalising communities across Ireland through jo creation, economic investment, and innovative services. Resonance now has 20,000 employees in Dublin. We take in thousands of interns each year from around the globe and provide them with an educational experience unmatched anywhere else. <br> The way we work is changing. As new technologies continue to unfold in the workplace, over a third of jobs are likely to require skills that are today uncommon in the workplace. Demographic changes and shifts in labor participation will mean future generations will find new ways to sustain economic growth. These changes create oppurtunities to think about how work can continue not just to be a source of income, but purpose and meaning for individuals and communities. Technology can help us seize these oppurtunites. Our goal is to help people connect more with eachother. </p>

Our policies and business practices reflect a commitment to making a positive impact in communities around the globe. This commitment doesn't just impact the type of services and products we develop, it is also central to why many of our employees come to work every day. Our aim is to help spark growth, competitiveness and economic opportunity for all. We endeavor to respect and champion human rights in the way we do business, and seek to advance those rights by applying the power of technology. We pursue the highest standard of corporate responsibility in all we do; supporting and empowering employees, working with clients and suppliers, and governing our company. </p>
        
        <h3>Security</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Building trust with our customers is central to our business success. Earning that trust starts with a foundation of principles to guide our own operations and how we impact the rights of people around the globe. We recognise privacy as a fundamental human right. We work to preserve our customer's ability to control their data and make informed choices to protect their privacy.<br> Our Approach:
        <ul>
